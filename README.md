## Getting Started

Begin your React journey with the basics. Learn about components, JSX, props, and state. Each concept is explained with simple, easy-to-understand examples.


## Basic Concepts

- **JSX âœ¨:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML in React.

- **Embedding Expressions in JSX:**
Declare a variable  and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.

- **Components:**
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.
    - `Functional Component`
    - `Class Component`

- **Props:**
Props (short for **"properties"**) are used to pass data from one component to another.

## Intermediate Concepts

Delve deeper into React with intermediate topics:
- **Event Handling**: Understand how to handle events in React.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Learn about class component lifecycle methods.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render different elements based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys**: Efficiently render lists of data.

## Advanced Concepts

Enhance your React knowledge with advanced concepts:
- **Hooks**: Use state and other React features without writing classes.
  - `useState`: Manage state in functional components.
  - `useEffect`: Handle side effects in functional components.
- **Context API**: Pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.
- **React Router**: Implement navigation in your React application.
- **State Management (Redux)**: Manage and centralize application state with Redux.

## Projects

Put your knowledge to the test with practical projects:
- **Counter App**: Build a simple counter application to practice basic React concepts.
- **Todo List App**: Build a simple todo list application to practice intermediate React concepts.
- **Weather App**: Create a weather application using advanced React concepts, including hooks and API integration.
