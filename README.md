## Basic Concepts
> For a comprehensive understanding of this topic, refer to our detailed guide [Here. Basic Concepts](Basics/Readme.md)
- **JSX âœ¨:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML in React.

- **Embedding Expressions in JSX:**
Declare a variable  and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.

- **Components:**
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.
    - `Functional Component`
    - `Class Component`

- **Props:**
Props (short for **"properties"**) are used to pass data from one component to another.

## Intermediate Concepts

> For a comprehensive understanding of this topic, refer to our detailed guide [Here. Intermediate Concepts](Intermediate/Readme.md)

Delve deeper into React with intermediate topics:
- **Event Handling**: Understand how to handle events in React.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Learn about class component lifecycle methods.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render different elements based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys**: Efficiently render lists of data.

## Advanced Concepts

> For a comprehensive understanding of this topic, refer to our detailed guide [Here. Advanced Concepts](Advanced/Readme.md).

Enhance your React knowledge with advanced concepts:
- **Hooks**: Use state and other React features without writing classes.
  - `useState`: Manage state in functional components.
  - `useEffect`: Handle side effects in functional components.
- **Context API**: Pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.
- **React Router**: Implement navigation in your React application.
- **State Management (Redux)**: Manage and centralize application state with Redux.

## Projects

Put your knowledge to the test with practical projects:
