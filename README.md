## Getting Started

Begin your React journey with the basics. Learn about components, JSX, props, and state. Each concept is explained with simple, easy-to-understand examples.


## Basic Concepts ðŸ“š

- **JSX âœ¨:**
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML in React.

- **Embedding Expressions in JSX:**
Declare a variable  and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.

- **Components:**
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based.
    - `Functional Component`
    - `Class Component`

- **Props:**
Props (short for **"properties"**) are used to pass data from one component to another.

## Intermediate Concepts

Delve deeper into React with intermediate topics:
- **Event Handling**: Understand how to handle events in React.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: Learn about class component lifecycle methods.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render different elements based on conditions.
- **Lists and Keys**: Efficiently render lists of data.

## Advanced Concepts

Enhance your React knowledge with advanced concepts:
- **Hooks**: Use state and other React features without writing classes.
  - `useState`: Manage state in functional components.
  - `useEffect`: Handle side effects in functional components.
- **Context API**: Pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.
- **React Router**: Implement navigation in your React application.
- **State Management (Redux)**: Manage and centralize application state with Redux.

## Projects

Put your knowledge to the test with practical projects:
- **Counter App**: Build a simple counter application to practice basic React concepts.
- **Todo List App**: Build a simple todo list application to practice intermediate React concepts.
- **Weather App**: Create a weather application using advanced React concepts, including hooks and API integration.

### Weather App Project

Follow the step-by-step guide to build a weather app:
1. **Set up the project**: Initialize a new React project.
2. **Install dependencies**: Add necessary libraries like Axios and React Router.
3. **Create components**: Build functional components for fetching and displaying weather data.
4. **Style the app**: Apply basic styling to your components.
5. **Run and test**: Start your app and test the functionality.

## Building and Deploying a React App

Learn how to build and deploy your React applications:
1. **Build the App**: Create an optimized production build.
2. **Deploy**: Deploy your app to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

### Example Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Install `gh-pages`:
   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```
2. Add deployment scripts to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```
3. Deploy the app:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
